  <h1>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h1>
    <p>Before I started this class I was familiar with the basics of document and web page accessibility. Learning about web standards and semantic HTML has taken my knowledge to the next level because now I better understand how screen readers interact with the code. Learning about accessibility is an empowering and marketable skill, especially since accessibility will likely become protected by law.</p>

  <h2>Why bother making your site accessible?</h2>
    <p>It's easy to brush off accessibility or get a negative attitude about it. I know because I've experienced push back at my institution. "How many blind people actually visit our site?" </p>

    <p>The truth is, it doesn't matter how many people. We know someone is and they matter. It's also required by law! Section 508 requires federal institutions to make all digital information accessible to everyone including disabled people. AND it's the right thing to do.</p>

    <p>Not to mention making your website accessible improves the overall user experience and also boosts your SEO.</p>

    <p>Web accessibility has the power to include others and improve someone's life by making information available and usable. I try to incorporate accessibility into my workflow through writing in plain langauge, writing descriptive hyperlinks, using structure and styles in my documents, and adding alt text, especially when I'm creating training materials or working on external-facing resources. As long as I'm learning new things about accessibility I'm on the right track.</p>

  <h2>Areas for Learning: ARIAs (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)</h2>

    <p>I still need to learn more about using arias effectively. I played around with using the role tag and found that it was unnecessary for most situations using semantic HTML5. I was going to add a button role to my nav link in my CSS project, but I realized that I could change it to be a button tag instead and therefore wouldn't need the role tag. (I realize that messing with the HTML might not be a part of the assignment but I'm nerding out on it.)

  <h2>Accessibility for the Modern Web</h2>  
    <p>This was an interesting talk on web accessibility, and it brought up a lot of good points. Businesses need to stop exculding an entire segment of their audience. Accessibility and usability testing should be at the forefront of any design process.</p>

  <h3>Why do we need to incorporate these accessibility hacks?</h3>
    <q>Because of the decisions someone else made.</q> <cite>~Derek Featherstone</cite>

    <p class="special-text">Derek sure has come up with some clever fixes though!</p>

    <p><strong>It reminds us that accessibility is something to focus on throughout development and testing.</strong> It's not an add-on for later, but hacks can be made to improve the user experience. Accessibility needs to be adopted as part of the workflow and businesses need to be held accountable for inaccessible products.
    </p>

    <p>It's important to continue learning and working towards accessibility in everything we develop.</p>
